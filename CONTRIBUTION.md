# Contribution guidlines

## Suggest new pages

To suggest pages that could fit the wiki, the recommanded may is to open an issue containing a summary of the page, the section in which it should be (General, Internal projects of Pharo or External projects of Pharo) and optionaly links to already existing documentation on the projects.

## Entries structure

The entries structure is free but we still have some conventions. 

* Documentation on external projects should mostly contains small example, comparaisons between multiple projects, links to official documentations and repositories. We can accept documentation on the external projects in case there is none by the official maintainer.
* Long entries should begin with a table of content. We recommand [https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/](https://ecotrust-canada.github.io/markdown-toc/).
* References to external/decentralized documentation should be in a *See also* section at the end of the entry.
* Smalltalk snippets should be highlighted using this format:


<pre>```Smalltalk
  Code
```</pre>
