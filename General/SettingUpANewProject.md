# Setting up a new project

In this article, I will describe the workflow I use for setting up a new project in Pharo. I will guide you through the whole process from getting a new Pharo image, creating the GitHub repository, and setting up the CI.

## 1. Get a fresh Pharo image

## 2. Create a package and a class

## 3. Write some tests

## 4. Create repository on GitHub

## 5. Load the repository into your image

## 6. Add your package and do the first commit

## 7. Create a baseline and a Metacello script

## 8. Set up the continuous integration (CI)

## 9. Add badges to your README.md
