# Setting up a new project

In this article, I will describe the workflow I use for setting up a new project in Pharo. I will guide you through the whole process from getting a new Pharo image, creating the GitHub repository, and setting up the CI.

## Step 0. Download and install Pharo Launcher

In order to work with Pharo, you should dowload and install Pharo Launcher - a tool for managing Pharo images. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS in both 32bit and 64bit version and can be dowloaded from [http://pharo.org/download]().

## Step 1. Get a fresh Pharo image

Instructions in this tutorial were written for Pharo 8, 64bit. But they should also work fine for Pharo 7. I suggest that you start your new project with the latest development version of Pharo.

Open your Pharo Launcher. You will see two panels:

- **New Image Templetes** on the left - here you can select a template of a new image that you want to create on your machine.
- **Current Images** on the right - created images will appear here. By double-clicking on image name, you can launch it.

Open the list of `Official distributions` in the left panel and double-click on the latest development version of Pharo. In my case, this is `Pharo 8.0 - 64bit (development version, latest)`. Give a nice descriptive name to your new image and press `OK`. You can now find your image in the right panel. Launch it by double-clicking on the image name.
