# Playground
Is a window into which you can type input. It can be used for any purpose, 
but is most often used for typing Pharo expressions and executing them via Do it. We have already briefly
encountered the Playground (and the Transcript) in Chapter 0.8 : A Quick Tour of Pharo.

You can open it with the shortcut `âŒ˜OW`or in the image:

## Basic usage
We can use Playground to quickly execute Pharo code
